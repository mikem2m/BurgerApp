**ABOUT THE BURGER APP**
*******************************

A web application that was designed to allow users to create and order their favourite burger. Users could then view their orders when they are logged in to the application. This web application is compatible with both desktop and mobile screen sizes. The Burger App is being hosted here: https://mikem2m.github.io/BurgerApp/

Tools : React | Redux | Firebase | Axios

**How the app stores user information:**

The Burger App is using Firebase as the backend "cloud" database to store both user data and their 'active' orders.

Currently, the Burger App is running under a free firebase account with limited quota.
